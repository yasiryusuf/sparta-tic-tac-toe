## JQuery Selectors and Events - TicTacToe

You challenge is build the game TicTacToe in the browser using JQuery. We will give you the html layout for the game. We will need you to use what you have learnt so far with selecting things with JQuery and creating event listeners with JQuery to create this game.

Your deliverables:-

1) Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2) Me and Joe added as contributors
3) Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4) pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5) The game should display the correct 'X' or 'O' for each button pressed in the browser
6) Once a tile has been clicked it should not be able to be clicked again
7) The clear button should clear the board
8) When a winning condition is present you should display a winner, either X or O
9) The program should use functions, loops, JQuery selectors and JQuery events


## Pros

i managed to plan in a better structure, to break sections up, starting from logically thinking what i need to do first, how the game would
work and what sections i would need, this type of thinking made it easier to understand what i am trying to do and also made it simpler to code.
i got the grasp of Jquery and i feel as if it lessens the load and time in comparison to writing out all of the javascript code. i find it easier to target HTML which in turn helps to understand how to edit or manipulate it. 

## cons

the cons as you can already see is that the code i am trying to write is not running properly, i feel i need to learn more about JQuery and understand the full power of it. As even though i understand what i need to do when i target a property i am not sure what way it is done with JQuery.
